# Commit Messages

If you are not familiar with Git please read the [HowTo](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim/wikis/development/howtogit)

A good article regarding [good commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

Every commit message must be prefixed with one of the following tags:

- ci
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- chore
- other

Further the first letter after the tag must be upper case

Example:

`feat: New Button which does something`
